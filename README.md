# React Calculator App

A simple calculator web application built using React that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.



## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
- Clear current calculation and start over.
- Delete the last entered character.
- Toggle positive/negative sign of the current number.
- Evaluate the final result of the calculation.
- Prevent multiple use of the decimal point within a number.
- Tap sound effect on button press.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the calculator app: [Demo Link](https://github.com/WebGuyAshis)

## How to Use

1. Click on the buttons to input numbers and perform operations.
2. Use the "+/-" button to toggle the positive/negative sign of the current number.
3. Use the "%" button to calculate the modulus.
4. Use the "AC" button to clear all and start over.
5. Use the "DEL" button to delete the last character entered.
6. Use the "=" button to evaluate the final result of the calculation.
7. To input decimal numbers, use the "." button. It prevents multiple use of the decimal point.
8. Enjoy the tap sound effect when pressing buttons!

## Technologies Used

- React
- Math.js for calculations
- Audio effect using HTML5 <audio> element

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `public/`: Contains the HTML file and other static assets.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and application logic.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
